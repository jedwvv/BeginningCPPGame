# Solutions to "Beginning C++ through Game Programming, 3rd Ed."  
Exercises obtained from Beginning C++ through Game Programming, 3rd Edition by Michael Dawson.  
  
These are my attempts at the exercises that specifically asks to either write or modify a program from the book.  
The original unmodified code is also included in cases where I overhaul or make many changes to an original code from the book. Otherwise, the changes or additions are simply marked with comments.  
For example in Chapter 6 & 7 exercises, functions are rewritten to make them more efficient via the use of references and/or pointers, and so the main function is also modified in numerous ways.  
  
### Notes:  
- Coming from a Python background, I challenged myself with the earlier exercises to make them more interesting, adding additional features from the exercise requirement(s). These are commented in specific detail where it occurs. This is entirely for personal benefit.  
- As the concepts progressed in complexity (beginning Chapter 6), it became more beneficial for me to directly address the exercise goals in order to focus on the new and unfamiliar C++ concepts.
