# Solutions to "Beginning C++ through Game Programming, 3rd Ed."
## Exercises obtained from Beginning C++ through Game Programming, 3rd Edition by Michael Dawson.  
Solutions to exercises which asks to write or modify a program only.  
When modifying code from the book and most of the program is modified or overhauled, the original unmodified program is also included, otherwise the changes are marked with comments.  
- For example in Chapter 6 & 7 exercises, functions are rewritten to make them more efficient via the use of references and/or pointers, and so the main function is also modified in numerous ways.

Note: Coming from a Python background, I challenged myself with the earlier exercises to make the exercise more interesting, adding additional features from the exercise requirement(s). These are commented in specific detail where it occurs.
