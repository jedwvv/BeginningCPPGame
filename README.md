# Solutions to "Beginning C++ through Game Programming, 3rd Ed."
## Exercises obtained from Beginning C++ through Game Programming, 3rd Edition by Michael Dawson.  
Solutions to exercises which asks to write or modify a program only.  
When modifying code from the book and most of the program is modified or overhauled, the original unmodified program is also included, otherwise the changes are marked with comments.  
E.g. when overhauling functions to make them more efficient via the use of references and/or pointers (Chapter 6 & 7).
